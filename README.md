This app shows information about all media streams inside a video or audio files.

For **video** streams the app shows:
* File format name
* Video codec name
* Frame size
* 4 equidistant frames from the video stream

For **audio** streams:
* Audio codec name
* Bit rate
* Number of channels
* Channel layout
* Sample rate and format

For **subtitle** streams: title and language from streamâ€™s metadata.

The main purpose is to show how to use the output of [ffmpeg-android-maker](https://github.com/Javernaut/ffmpeg-android-maker).

Extensive description can be found in [this article](https://proandroiddev.com/a-story-about-ffmpeg-in-android-part-ii-integration-55fb217251f0).

Have a look at the app yourself:

## How it works

The codebase has a native part that glues FFmpeg libs to JVM part.  

FFmpeg accepts 2 types of input: File paths and File Descriptors. **File paths** are better and allow the FFmpeg to use all the functionality it has. **File Descriptors** can be passed to FFmpeg via pipe protocol, but it has certain [problems](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#pipe) like inability to seek backward. That is why the number of frames shown is limited to 4 only. Though the File protocol doesn't have this problem.  

App uses ACTION_GET_CONTENT to pick video/* files. So it can accept files from many different apps. The app ignores Storage Access Framework as many of standard and 3rd party apps do. Also app can handle ACTION_VIEW, when a video file is opened from another app.  

App tries to recreate a raw file path from a Uri and pass it to FFmpeg. If it doesn't succeed, it falls back to File Descriptor way.  

The app is simply structured: it uses the MVVM approach with components from [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx).   

The rest is pretty standard Android-related burden.  

And here is what it looks like:

| Video file with video, audio and subtitle streams | Audio file |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="images/screens/video.gif"> | <img src="images/screens/audio.gif"> |

| Handling ACTION_VIEW from Dropbox app | Picking file from Google Drive app |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="images/screens/dropbox.gif"> | <img src="images/screens/drive.gif"> |

## Prerequisites

First, initialise the submodule:  

`git submodule update --init`  

Then you need to setup and execute the ffmpeg-android-maker's script. The command used to generate the Play Store build looks like this:

`./ffmpeg-android-maker.sh -dav1d`

More details can be found in [ffmpeg-android-maker](https://github.com/Javernaut/ffmpeg-android-maker) repository.  

## How to use

Just import in Android Studio and run.
